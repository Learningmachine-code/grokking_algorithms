## Q.1.1

>Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?

Answer:
The formula is:
$$
x=log_2^n
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
n&=128\\
x&=7\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
$$

## Q.1.2

>1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?
>The answer is 8.

## Q.1.3-1.6

>1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number in the phone book.

>That can be $O(n)$ or $O(log_2^n)$

>1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole
book!)

>$O(n)$

>1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.

>$O(n)$

>1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (This is a tricky one! It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4. Read the
answer—you may be surprised!)

>$O(1)$
